# Medical Imaging (Project Summary)

## Project background
Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers around the world. It affects approximately 300 thousand people every year, with Denmark being in the top 5 countries with the most cases per population (Source: https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/skin-cancer-statistics/).

Thankfully, even though skin cancer can be fatal, early detection dramatically improves the survival rates of patients. Ideally, regular screenings would be available to everyone, but in reality, this is not always feasible.. Dermatologists are not accessible everywhere and if they are, frequent dermatologist visits are also not desirable due to economic reasons. 

This project is focused on improving the skin detection process by optimizing the time medical professionals spend evaluating whether skin lesions are cancerous.  Instead of relying solely on human assessment, the goal it to use a machine learning algorithm to automate and quicken the diagnosis process, making early detection more efficient and accessible.

## Dataset description
A key part of early detection is a review of the skin lesion that is thought to be cancerous. Eventhough, this is predominantly done by doctors, developing an automated programme can result in a more efficient and accessible check up for the patient. To create a useful model, we need it to be highly accurate. In order to do so we must analyse diverse types of skin lesions and this is represented in the dataset we are provided. To efficiently analyse the skin lesion dataset first we will need to cleanup any  distractions off the skin lesions which can degrade the model's accuracy. Most common example of this, is the hair present in the region of the patient's skin lesion. The patient's Hair can obstruct the lesion or confuse the model, or thus comprimising the models verdict
