# Medical Imaging (Project Summary)

## Project background
Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting approximately 300 thousand people every year. Thankfully, early detection of cancerous skin cells drastically improves the survival rates of patients. That being said, access to dermatologists is not accessible everywhere in the world. 

## Dataset description
A key part of early detection is a review of the skin lesion that is thought to be cancerous. Eventhough, this is predominantly done by doctors, developing an automated programme can result in a more efficient and accessible check up for the patient. We need to create a strong model which is accurate. In order to do so we must analyse and this is represented in the dataset we are provided.  From the data set, we see that there are various types of skin lesions that photographed-
